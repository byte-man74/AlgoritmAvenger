Yooo, I'm Sheryf Habib! 👋 I build cool stuffs. Really cool stuffs🌝. With circuit boards, internet and a keyboard 😌.
I build all kinds of computer programs, from phone apps to web-apps, even the apps that work on your i-watch and tv's. yes🫠


I enjoy building hardware and write code for embedded systems too - that's what got me started in programming. Since I have a solid understanding on electronics, 
its relatively easy for me to build stuffs with plain old wires, circuit boards, resistors ...etc you get the idea😅. For hardware projects, im down to building anything even if its not functional in the real world. If its just a cool project. I'm down to build it


On my day to day professional job tho, I focus on two main areas in software product development. 

(Growth Engineering)- So... I help businesses grow by making their products especially MVP's better and more popular. I look at how people use the product, test out different ideas, and make smart changes that help more users find and love what we build. By using real data and analytics strategies, I help turn promising software into successful products that keeps getting better. My focus is on finding clever ways to grow - whether that's making the product easier to use, helping more people discover it, or keeping users coming back for more. My main goal here is turning MVP's into products that users can't live without!

(MVP Engineering) – Then I also help businesses that don’t typically use or have software solutions in their workflow, By working with them, i help integrate software solutions into their workflow, making operations more efficient and helping them attract more customers. I build simple lean, testable MVPs that let us learn from real practical usage, before investing in complex features—ensuring we create what truly matters while saving time and resources.
